"I refuse to say anything beyond five years because I don't think we can see much beyond five years." - Geoffrey Hinton

In this project, I'm going to build some deep learning models to recode my learning journey.

> MLP: the bike prediction folder contains a MLP model predicting bike sharing volume using numpy

> CNN: the image classification project folder contains a CNN model classifing image from 10 different categories

> RNN: 

> LSTM: The tv_script folder contains a LSTM model which can generate TV_Script using tensorflow and keras

> GAN: The face_generation folder contains a GAN model which can generate synthetic human faces using tensorflow and keras 

the list will continue to expend 

Some thoughts 

The next move of this project will focus on the following to category

> building models using only numpy to help myself gain more insight on deep learning 

> building models that focusing on fraud investigation
